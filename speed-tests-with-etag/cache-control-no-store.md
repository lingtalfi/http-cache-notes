Http Cache test: Cache-Control no-store
=============================
2016-10-16

ETag is always on in those tests.


I want to see the effect of "Cache-Control no-store" on the following browsers:
ff49, chrome53, safari10, opera40.


The expected behaviour is the following (quote from https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching): 

```
By contrast, "no-store" is much simpler. It simply disallows the browser and all intermediate caches from storing any version of the returned responseâ€”for example, one containing private personal or banking data. Every time the user requests this asset, a request is sent to the server and a full response is downloaded.
```




Conclusion
--------------
The "Cache-Control: no store" is effective to tell browsers NOT TO cache a resource (at least html or css resource).






Test1
==========

First, let's apply the "Cache-Control: no-store" header to the html page.

(nginx)
```nginx
Cache-control no-store;
```

Results on an html page
----------------------------

ff49, chrome53, safari10, opera40:
The index.html page is never cached. The browser never provides the "If-Modified-Since" or the "If-None-Match" headers.


Note: all browsers provided a "Cache-Control: max-age=0" header.






Results on a css stylesheet
--------------------------------

Let's apply the following nginx conf to the css stylesheet:

```nginx
location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico)$ {
        add_header Cache-Control no-store;
}
```

ff49, chrome53, safari10, opera40:
The css resource is never cached. The browser never provides the "If-Modified-Since" or the "If-None-Match" headers.
